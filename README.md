# Proto-Voices

An implementation of the proto-voice model.

To run the example you need [`stack`](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/),
which takes care of all necessary haskell tools and dependencies.

```shell
$ stack build
$ stack exec ismir2021
```

The code for the above program can be found in `app/MainISMIR.hs`.
The remaining code is in `src/`.
